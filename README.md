# AITA

An AI Teaching Assistant (AI TA) that provides an interactive platform for students to ask questions and receive guidance on course materials.

Project 1: AI Teaching Assistant
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an AI Teaching Assistant (AI TA). The AI TA aims to provide an interactive platform for students to ask questions and receive guidance on course materials, mirroring the support traditionally offered by human teaching assistants. The project emphasizes the application of NLP techniques to create an educational tool that enhances the learning experience through dynamic interaction and content understanding.
Project Objectives
• Automate FAQ Responses: Develop the AI TA to autonomously address frequently asked questions related to course logistics, assignments, and content.
• Content Understanding and Query Handling: Implement NLP strategies enabling the AI TA to interpret and respond to inquiries about the uploaded course material accurately.
• Dynamic Interaction: Design the AI TA to interact with students conversationally, providing information and resources pertinent to their queries.
Technical Approach
NLP Engine Components
• Language Model Integration: Leverage pre-trained NLP models (e.g., BERT, Llama)
for robust text understanding and generation, tapping into their vast linguistic knowledge.
• Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Employ models like BERT for NLU tasks to accurately parse student inquiries, determining their intent and extracting relevant details for precise responses.
• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Central to the NLP Engine, RAG com- bines retrieval methods (to access information within a structured database of course materials) with generative capabilities (to formulate coherent and context-aware respon- ses). This approach ensures the AI TA delivers informative answers, directly pulling from course content and synthesizing it into helpful responses.
• Response Generation: Utilize the designed AI TA to generate responses that are not only accurate but also engaging and pedagogically effective.
Interaction Interface
• Simplified Interface Development: Construct an intuitive web or command-line in- terface that allows straightforward question submission and response retrieval, ensuring ease of use for student interactions with the AI TA.

# Summary

This repository contains the code for the AI Teaching Assistant project. The project aims to create an AI Teaching Assistant (AI TA) that provides an interactive platform for students to ask questions and receive guidance on course materials. The AI TA is designed to automate FAQ responses, understand and handle queries about course content, and interact with students conversationally.
